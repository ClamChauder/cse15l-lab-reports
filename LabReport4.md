## Lab Report 4 - Vim (Week 7)
---

Keys Pressed:
`<up><up><enter>`
I used the arrow keys to access the `ssh bpchau@ieng6.ucsd.edu` command which was 2 up in the search history.

`<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>` I was not sure how far up the `git clone` command was, so I used the arrow keys, but it would have been faster if I had typed it out.
