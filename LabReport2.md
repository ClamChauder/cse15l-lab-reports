# Lab Report 2

Upon using `ssh` to login to the `ieng6` server, I got a message asking to confirm the authenticity of the server and decide whether or not I wanted to continue connecting. After connecting, I noticed the cluster status which I believe displays the three different `ieng6` computers that I could have connected to, as well as the time at which I connected, the number of users connected to each host, and the average CPU load for different time frames.
